the part they will select choices namely: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, and Mixed. After choosing one of the choices, the program will generate two random numbers with the selected 
operation.For example, the user chose Addition. It will generate 1. num1 + num2. If the user inputs a correct answer, the program will output correct. if not, it will output wrong. After the 10 items, the program 
will automatically show the leaderboards of the said operation, from highest score to lowest score. After that, the program will ask if you want to play again. If yes, it will loop again to the start where the 
program will ask again what operation will you like to choose. If no, the loop will break and the program will display goodbye message and break.
